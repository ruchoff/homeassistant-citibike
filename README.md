This integration provides real-time data about NYC Citi Bike stations within Home Assistant. By fetching information from the official Citi Bike GBFS feed, it monitors available bikes, docking spaces, and station status, helping you track bike availability in real-time.

## Features
- Track the number of available bikes and docking spaces at each station
- Monitor station status, including whether bikes are available for renting and if the station is accepting bike returns
- Display additional station attributes, such as location, capacity, and availability of bike types
- Automatically updates data at regular intervals to provide real-time information

## Installation
### HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
[![Add to HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ruchoff&repository=homeassistant-citibike)

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `citibike` folder from this repository.
2. Copy the `citibike` folder into your `custom_components` directory in Home Assistant.


### Configuration

1. In Home Assistant, navigate to **Configuration** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for "CitiBike".
3. Enter the **Station ID** for the CitiBike station you want to monitor. You can find this ID on [CitiBike's Explore page](https://citibikenyc.com/explore). Simply select a station on the map, and the Site ID will appear at the bottom of the information card.
4. Optionally, provide a **Sensor Name** to customize the sensor entity name (if left blank, the default sensor name will be generated based on the stationâ€™s ID and name).

### Example Sensor Names:
| **Station ID** | **Station Name** | **Generated Sensor Name** |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| `6432.11`      | `Null`           | `sensor.citibike_station_6432_11_e_40_st_park_ave` |
